==Abstract==

A method is proposed for online verification of ONT ID ownership. Trust anchors or other entities can use this method for identity authentication. 
This method is based on the same cryptographic principles as is used during caller identification in smart-contract execution.

==Motivation==

Currently there is no recommended or established way of ONT ID ownership verification in web environment. Main motivation is to guide implementators of services interacting with ONT ID identity to use common principles and to prevent implementations which are not secure. 

==Specification==

This proposal makes use of the following functions and definitions:

*'''SHA256''', a well-known hashing algorithm that takes an arbitrary number of bytes as input and deterministically yields a 32-byte hash.



The technical specification should describe the syntax and semantics of any new feature. The specification should be detailed enough to allow competing, interoperable implementations for any of the current ONT platforms.

==Rationale==

'''''User story:''' As a Service Provider, I need to check if the requester is really who he claims to be, before providing the service.''

or more specifically

'''''User story:''' As a Trust Anchor who would like to issue a verificable claim, I need to check if the requester is really who he claims to be.''
